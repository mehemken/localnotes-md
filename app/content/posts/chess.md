Some people have football, some people have League of Legends. Some people smoke weed and some people try to get laid. There are many things you could do with your time outside of the day job. I happen to be doing a lot of BJJ and chess. As a matter of fact, I play too much chess during my day job.

One of those things happens to be business. Some people spend their extra time building a business. Time outside the day job is really entrepreneurial time. You spend it to maximize something that scratches an itch. For some poeple it's the excitement that comes from watching your team win. For others it's a virtualy battle of mana and plasma. Some people just chase a chemically induced high and some don't feel adequate unless they're getting laid. All of these things promise a return on investment of time. Just what that return is varies a lot. For the people who build businesses, that return must be measured (at least in part) in dollars.

##Chess
In the last year and a half, I've improved my blitz chess by almost 500 rating points. This is a very large increase. There are people who cannot or are not driven enough to make that much progress. Granted, I have a cushy office job where I can play online a couple hours a day and not get caught or reprimanded. Granted, I analyze most of my games immediately after I play them and learn from my mistakes. The truth is that I like playing chess. There are times when the game clock is close on both sides and nobody has a clear advantage, but both players know that someone is going to win on time. Sometimes I'm losing on time but I am close to a check mate, but I'm not sure if I will make it. In these situations I feel my heart beat faster and I get an adrenaline rush.

I play on [lichess.com](https://en.lichess.org/@/fanoftal2) and the site keeps track of my games and ratings progress. At the time of this writing I've spent a total of 28 days, 11 hours and 37 minutes playing chess. Keep in mind most of those hours were spent plaing in my cubicle at work. I realized about a year ago that this is really too much and that I should tell someone who can help me cut down. But I don't know who to talk to about it.

If indeed my job is so lenient and I'm so inclined to neglect it at that scale, why should I invest that time in chess? Are there not other, more fruitful ventures?

##BJJ
I've done brazilian jiu jitsu in two stints. In 2014 I did it for 6 months between March and September. Then I had a knee injury and I stopped. I've been back at it since January of this year (2016) and I've been training consistently 3 or more times per week. I can submit most white belts at my academy [LevelUp BJJ](http://levelupjiujitsu.com/) and I've even submited a couple of blue belts. I can control and submit men who outweigh me by 50 pounds. 

I've spent many hours thinking about jiu jitsu and many hours on the mat. If we assume that I spend two hours on the mat each time I go to train, and that I train three times per week, this year alone I've spent a total of eight days on the mat. Add to that the weekend Jiu Jitsu Connection sessions and the dinners after training and the extra days I train when we have guests over from other academies and it adds up. I've spent a whole lot of my time not only perfecting my technique, but making friends and being part of the community of Level Up.

I'm not a professional, but as a fitness hobby, this is demanding a lot of my time spent outside my day job. I have to ask again because time is currency that may only be spent once, are there no other, more fruitful ventures?

##Opportunity cost
Jiu jitsu is definitely worth the investment of time. It keeps me fit and I have friendships that have come out of it. Chess, on the other hand, is more difficult to justify. I've gained no friendships from it because I practice alone. I do think that it's been beneficial because I've developed very strategic ways of solving problems. In chess, you cannot check every move because the variations quickly overwhelm the human memory. So a player must know where to focus his energies. There are many methodologies that help chess players decide on a move and the ones that I've found helpful in chess, are also helpful in real life. The difference is that in chess there are only 32 pieces and 64 squares; in real life there are infinitely many moving 'pieces' and the playing field is continuous, not discrete. This makes for exponentially more complex situations. Luckily, we have an evolved mamalian brain that handles the more tedious complexities. Decision making in chess gives people a framework for making decisions and a lot of the framework can be generalized to any kind of decision making.

So BJJ is for pysical fitness and chess is for decisive fitness.

##Business
Having a job is extremely risky. If a hedge fund put all of its cash in a single security, no sane person would buy it. We must all be insane, then, because so many of us rely on a single job for all of our income. Thus we should strive to diversify our incomes. But when? Where do we find the time to do that convincingly? We invest half of our waking lives into the day job and the rest of the time into our hobbies, relationships, chores etc. How can anybody have enough time to invest in a diversified income?

Well there is no easy answer here. By method of elimination, you just neglect one of the other things. If you have ten hours to get something done, and you want to get it done, then you allocate some of that time to getting it done. If you also have several other things to get done then you have to make decisions. Say you have three goals, and to complete all three of them would require 15 hours. Well you only have ten hours. How the hell are you going to get it all done? By method of elimination, you won't.


##Entreprenurial time
Sometimes time and money can be interchangeable. You can give your time to earn money and you can pay money to save time. The idea of entrepreneurial time is based on invesing time now build cashflow that can make it possible to save all the time you want to save. Then you can use all your saved time to do the things you really want to spend your time doing. But you have to allocate that time now. The cashflow doesn't just happen. I believe the trick is to build a business in a few stages. 

First you exchange your time for no money. This is where you spend time developing a skill that you will later be able to leverage for income. This is also the time when you begin to build a professional network. You will spend your time acquiring new relationships and you will not be compensated.

Second you exchange your time for money. Once you have a skill and some customers, you can start earning money. This is a direct exchange of time for money. In a perfect world you would still have your day job, but you would also have this side income. This is nice because now you have two streams of income. This is better, but still pretty risky. There is a choke point in that cashflow and that chokepoint is you. If you somehow lose your ability to work, you're screwed.

Third you exchange other people's time for money. This is when you can start hiring people to do what you've been doing all along. But you will need people who have the skill you have. The best way to get those is by teaching. If you teach many people how to do what you do, some of them may end up working for you. You are in a perfect position to set them up with some cash flow. At this point it is a matter of further expanding your customer base and matching your workers with your customers.

Fourth you want to automate everything. You want to build an army of skilled labor as well as the support staff to make them better at doing their job. A natural process of organizations is employee churn. People leave after a while. So you have to build a machine that will automatically handle that churn. Eventually you will want to extract yourself from the day to day decision making and make only strategic and philosophical decisions.

At this point you have some steady chashflow that is based on the work of other people. You've ensured that it is in the best interests of your employees to keep working for you and you've put in place a system to replace the people who leave. You also have a system in place to improve the skills of your current employees. You're basically free to do whatever you want. You also have some cash to spend when you want to avoid spending time doing something you don't want to do.
