##Live code reloading

[This site](http://paislee.io/the-ultimate-nodejs-development-setup-with-docker/) might have the answer. Yes the answer is in there. Just implement it. Correction, the answer is implied. I might need to find more info.

The answer seems to be `nodemon`, a wrapper around `node` that watches for changes in the codebase and restarts the server.

I've made the executive decision that I'm not familiar enough with `node` to execute this setup. The code reloading on save thing is a feature of the app in question, not docker.
