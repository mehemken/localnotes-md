This is my personal cache of articles. I write things here that I like to write about and if it is helpful for you then I'm glad you found it.

My name is Marco Emilio Hemken and I was born in Mexico City in 1990. I played bassoon for a few years and I miss those days. I was the national rubik's cube record holder for Mexico in 2007 and 2008. My current goals are two.

1. Create an income based on programming.
  I prefer if the programming can be building data pipelines for people and small businesses.

2. Get my black belt in brazilian jiu jitsu.
  This will take about ten more years. I am currently a white belt with two stripes and I only train 3-4 times a week.
